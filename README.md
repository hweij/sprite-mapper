# Sprite mapper

Web app to create a sprite map / atlas from a set of source images.

This app has been developed for my own use (generate sprite sheets for a PixiJS application) and serves its purpose well.
I may improve it over time.

Other and better tools to do this exist, but this one allows me to tune it to my needs.
